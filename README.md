- ### Design

	- ### Colour Scheme

		The two main colours used are the teal and orange colours from the business logo and white.

	- ### Typography

		The Cantarell font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Cantarell is the font used in the company logo, which reinforces the business' branding. It is crisp and easy to read which is appropriate for legibility. It is also a stylish font, which reflects the aesthetic nature of the business.

	-	### Imagery

		Imagery is important. The large, background hero image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. It is also an image from the client's portfolio of work, and so showcases their skills and style. The business logo is also featured, which aims to make the businesses' branding recognisable to the client. A smiling image of the business owener is also included to reinforce the friendly and approachable reputation of the company.

## Features

### Existing Features

	-   The navigation bar is responsive supporting easy navigation. On small screens (e.g. on mobile devices it becomes a hamburger menu)

- **F02 Hero Image**
	-   The hero image is an impressive photograph from the business' portfolio of work, which helps to identify the purpose of the business and the type of services it sells. 
	- The image is responsive, and so changes size and shape on different screen sizes (e.g. on mobile devices it becomes a small square)
![Laptop view of hero image](https://github.com/SamarZiadat/charlotte-the-decorator/blob/main/documentation/supporting-images/wide-hero.png?raw=true)
![View of hero-image on a narrow screen](https://github.com/SamarZiadat/charlotte-the-decorator/blob/main/documentation/supporting-images/small-hero.png?raw=true)	
- **F03 About Section**

	- It includes: 
		- A smiling portrait of he business owner, which reinforces the business' friendly and approachable take to its services

		- Further text about the business if the user would like to know more 
	- This section is responsive with the use of flexbox; the image and text change size and placement on different screen sizes 
![About section as viewed on laptop](https://github.com/SamarZiadat/charlotte-the-decorator/blob/main/documentation/supporting-images/wide-about.png?raw=true)
- **F04 Services Section**
	- Two tables are used to display the services that the business provides in a clear and organised way
	- These tables are stacked using flexbox to limit how much information is taken in by the user at once, reducing overwhelm 
![Services section as viewed on laptop](https://github.com/SamarZiadat/charlotte-the-decorator/blob/main/documentation/supporting-images/wide-services.png?raw=true)

- **F05 Testimonials Section**
	- This section includes three testimonials from past customers, including their written review, their rating out of 5 stars using icons from front awesome, and the first name of the customer.

- **F06 Contact Form**
	- The Contact section of the website allows the user to send a message/give feedback to the business. The user is asked to provide their name and email address when sending a message. Sending the message will result in a new tab showing the results (at the moment the user is simply shown the formdump.codeinstitute.net page with the data they submitted displayed)
	- This form is essential, as it allows the user to request quotes or estimates for the business' services, as well as request more information about these services 
![Contact form as viewed on lapt](https://github.com/SamarZiadat/charlotte-the-decorator/blob/main/documentation/supporting-images/wide-contact.png?raw=true)

		-   An external link to the business' portfolio of work on instagram (this opens in a separate tab so the user easily returns to the website to get in touch after viewing examples of the business' work)
