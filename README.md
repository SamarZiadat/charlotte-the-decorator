- ### Design

	- ### Colour Scheme

		The two main colours used are the teal and orange colours from the business logo and white.

	- ### Typography

		The Cantarell font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Cantarell is the font used in the company logo, which reinforces the business' branding. It is crisp and easy to read which is appropriate for legibility. It is also a stylish font, which reflects the aesthetic nature of the business.

	-	### Imagery

		Imagery is important. The large, background hero image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. It is also an image from the client's portfolio of work, and so showcases their skills and style. The business logo is also featured, which aims to make the businesses' branding recognisable to the client. A smiling image of the business owener is also included to reinforce the friendly and approachable reputation of the company.
