## Design
### Colour Scheme
The two main colours used are the teal and orange colours from the business logo and white.
### Typography
The Cantarell font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Cantarell is the font used in the company logo, which reinforces the business' branding. It is crisp and easy to read which is appropriate for legibility. It is also a stylish font, which reflects the aesthetic nature of the business. 
### Imagery
Imagery is important. The large, background hero image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. It is also an image from the client's portfolio of work, and so showcases their skills and style. The business logo is also featured, which aims to make the businesses' branding recognisable to the client. A smiling image of the business owener is also included to reinforce the friendly and approachable reputation of the company.

    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organisation.
    - Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the section of their choice. Underneath there is a Hero Image, which is followed by an 'about section.

    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.
    - The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. The navigation bar is fixed and follows the user's scroll, each link describes what the page they will end up at clearly.
