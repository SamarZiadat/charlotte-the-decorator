- ### Design

	- ### Colour Scheme

		The two main colours used are the teal and orange colours from the business logo and white.

	- ### Typography

		The Cantarell font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Cantarell is the font used in the company logo, which reinforces the business' branding. It is crisp and easy to read which is appropriate for legibility. It is also a stylish font, which reflects the aesthetic nature of the business.

	-	### Imagery

		Imagery is important. The large, background hero image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. It is also an image from the client's portfolio of work, and so showcases their skills and style. The business logo is also featured, which aims to make the businesses' branding recognisable to the client. A smiling image of the business owener is also included to reinforce the friendly and approachable reputation of the company.

## Features

### Existing Features

- **F01 Navigation Bar**

	-   The navigation bar is responsive supporting easy navigation. On small screens (e.g. on mobile devices it becomes a hamburger menu)
	- The colours used in the navigation bar/hamburger menu draw from the colours used in the logo for consistency (this colour scheme also carries on throughout the rest of the website)
	- The navigation includes: 
		- The business' Logo (which links back to the top of the page when scrolling)
		- Links to the About, Services, Testimonials and Contact sections
		- An external link to the company Instagram (which opens in a separate tab)
![Navigation bar](https://github.com/SamarZiadat/charlotte-the-decorator/blob/main/documentation/supporting-images/wide-nav.png?raw=true)
![Navigation drop-down](https://github.com/SamarZiadat/charlotte-the-decorator/blob/main/documentation/supporting-images/dropdown-menu.png?raw=true)
- **F02 Hero Image**
	-   The hero image is an impressive photograph from the business' portfolio of work, which helps to identify the purpose of the business and the type of services it sells. 
	- The image is responsive, and so changes size and shape on different screen sizes (e.g. on mobile devices it becomes a small square)
![Laptop view of hero image](https://github.com/SamarZiadat/charlotte-the-decorator/blob/main/documentation/supporting-images/wide-hero.png?raw=true)
![View of hero-image on a narrow screen](https://github.com/SamarZiadat/charlotte-the-decorator/blob/main/documentation/supporting-images/small-hero.png?raw=true)	
- **F03 About Section**
	- The about section is directly under the hero image, and is the first section where the user comes across significant text. 
	- It includes: 
		- A smiling portrait of he business owner, which reinforces the business' friendly and approachable take to its services
		- Short, snappy sentences (featuring icons) about the business owner's qualifications, experience, certification and insurance, which reassures the user of business owner's skills, experience and training
		- Further text about the business if the user would like to know more 
	- This section is responsive with the use of flexbox; the image and text change size and placement on different screen sizes 
![About section as viewed on laptop](https://github.com/SamarZiadat/charlotte-the-decorator/blob/main/documentation/supporting-images/wide-about.png?raw=true)
- **F04 Services Section**
	- Two tables are used to display the services that the business provides in a clear and organised way
	- These tables are stacked using flexbox to limit how much information is taken in by the user at once, reducing overwhelm 
![Services section as viewed on laptop](https://github.com/SamarZiadat/charlotte-the-decorator/blob/main/documentation/supporting-images/wide-services.png?raw=true)

- **F05 Testimonials Section**
	- This section includes three testimonials from past customers, including their written review, their rating out of 5 stars using icons from front awesome, and the first name of the customer. 
	- These testimonials speak to the reputation of the business, and further reinforces the friendly and helpful service provided.
![Testimonials as viewed on laptop](https://github.com/SamarZiadat/charlotte-the-decorator/blob/main/documentation/supporting-images/wide-testimonials.png?raw=true)

- **F06 Contact Form**
	- The Contact section of the website allows the user to send a message/give feedback to the business. The user is asked to provide their name and email address when sending a message. Sending the message will result in a new tab showing the results (at the moment the user is simply shown the formdump.codeinstitute.net page with the data they submitted displayed)
	- This form is essential, as it allows the user to request quotes or estimates for the business' services, as well as request more information about these services 
![Contact form as viewed on lapt](https://github.com/SamarZiadat/charlotte-the-decorator/blob/main/documentation/supporting-images/wide-contact.png?raw=true)
- **F07 Footer**
	- The footer is featured at the bottom of the page and features:
		-   A call to action to 'Get in touch' which is the central way that this business sells its services 
	    -  Essential contact details for the business including the email address and telephone number, giving users an alternative way to get in touch outside of filling in the from
		-   An external link to the business' portfolio of work on instagram (this opens in a separate tab so the user easily returns to the website to get in touch after viewing examples of the business' work)

## Testing

### Validator Testing 
The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.
- [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) - [Results](https://github.com/SamarZiadat/charlotte-the-decorator/blob/main/documentation/validation-results/css-validator-results.pdf)

![CSS validator results](https://github.com/SamarZiadat/charlotte-the-decorator/blob/main/documentation/validation-results/css-validator-results-screenshot.png?raw=true)

- [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) - [Results](https://github.com/SamarZiadat/charlotte-the-decorator/blob/main/documentation/validation-results/html-validator-results.pdf)

![HTML validator results ](https://github.com/SamarZiadat/charlotte-the-decorator/blob/main/documentation/validation-results/html-validator-results-screenshot.png?raw=true)
 
The warning is due to there being no heading in the host image section of the html (which has a div with an id tag).

### Lighthouse Test
[Google's web.dev page quality test](https://web.dev/measure/) was used to measure the website against performance, accessibility, SEO and best practice. 

 - **Performance** 
![Lighthouse test performance score](https://github.com/SamarZiadat/charlotte-the-decorator/blob/main/documentation/supporting-images/lighthouse-performance.png?raw=true)

- **Accessibility** 
	- *Before*
	 Initially, accessibility was rated at 84, due to a label in the header having no text:
`<input  type="checkbox"  id="nav-toggle"  class="nav-toggle"><label  for="nav-toggle"  class="nav-toggle-label"><span  id="hidden-span">nav</span></label>`
This label is purposefully empty as part of an unusual method for creating a hamburger menu without JavaScript. 
![Initial lighthouse accessibility rating](https://github.com/SamarZiadat/charlotte-the-decorator/blob/main/documentation/supporting-images/lighthouse-accessibility-before.png?raw=true)
	
	- *After*
	In order to boost this accessibility score, text was entered into the label, and then styled in white with CSS so as not to disrupt the design of the hamburger menu. The resulting code: `<input  type="checkbox"  id="nav-toggle"  class="nav-toggle"><label  for="nav-toggle"  class="nav-toggle-label"><span  id="hidden-span">nav</span></label>`
	This boosted the accessibility score from 85 to 96.

- **SEO**
